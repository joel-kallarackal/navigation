obstacle_range: 2.5 #maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap
raytrace_range: 3.0 #the range to which freespace will be raytraced
footprint: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]] #defines coordinates of robot outline,use robot_radius if the bot is circular
#robot_radius: ir_of_robot
inflation_radius: 0.55 #maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred

observation_sources: point_cloud_sensor #list of sensors that are going to be passing information to the costmap separated by spaces

point_cloud_sensor: {sensor_frame: zed_camera, data_type: PointCloud2, topic: /camera/depth/points, marking: true, clearing: true}

#"frame_name" parameter should be set to the name of the coordinate frame of the sensor
#"data_type" parameter should be set to LaserScan or PointCloud depending on which message the topic uses
#"topic_name" should be set to the name of the topic that the sensor publishes data on
#"marking" and "clearing" parameters determine whether the sensor will be used to add obstacle information to the costmap, clear obstacle information from the costmap, or do both.
#"min_obstacle_height" sets the minimum height in meters of a sensor reading considered valid
#"max_obstacle_height" sets the maximum height in meters of a sensor reading considered valid
#"obstacle_range"
#"raytrace_range"
